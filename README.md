# shortest-path

We are looking for the shortest part from a point A to a point B given their latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates. For achieving our goal, we first create a class Node that describes a given node of our work. The concept of graph theory will be used for this work.

As library, we will use networkx for drawing the graph and matplolib for displaying it
