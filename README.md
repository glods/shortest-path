We are looking for the shortest part from a point A to a point B given their latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates. For achieving our goal, we first create a class Node that describes a given node of our work. We will the graph theory for this work.

As library, we will use networkx for drawing the graph and matplolib for displaying it
